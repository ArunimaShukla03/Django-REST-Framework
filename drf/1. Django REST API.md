- REST API stands for "Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface"

- It is a way for different software components to communicate with each other (these components can be anything from a react.js or vue.js application to a django or fast api project).

- a "software component" or a "piece of software" generally refers to individualistic parts that have their own functionality in a large software program (a "software program" can range from a simple calculator to a complex operating system or web browser).

# flask

- micro web-framework (minimalistic, simple and only essential tools for web applications are provided)

- more control over code and project structure

- doesn't have a built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

    1. ORM is used to manage data and eliminate the need for direct interaction with SQL queries.

    2. As django has built-in ORM that means it has an ability to create "models" that eliminate the need to worry about the underlying SQL queries. 

    3. We can also use ORM in flask with the help of ORM libraries (such as SQLAlchemy). 

    4. The absence of built-in ORM in flask is not about eliminating ORM altogether but rather about not enforcing a specific ORM solution. Flask empowers the developers to make their own decision and choose from the wide-set of available ORM libraries depending on their needs and preferences.
